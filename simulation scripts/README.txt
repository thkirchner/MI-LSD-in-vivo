in order to run this you will need to install both:
- Monte Carlo Extreme (mcx)
- The Simulation and Image Processing for Photoacoustic Imaging (SIMPA) toolkit. simpa.readthedocs.io/en/develop/
The latter was formerly (and in these simulation scripts) called ippai and is currently undergoing restructuring.
